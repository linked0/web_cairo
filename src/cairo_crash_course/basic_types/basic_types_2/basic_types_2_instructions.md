# Cairo Crash Course 

## Basic Data Types - Exercise 2 - You get me constantly
Now, let's deep dive into the next exercise, where we will revise the getter functions of a smart contract! Ready, set go! ⭐🌟✨💫

### Contract Implementation

- In the `basic_types_exercises_2.cairo` file, create three constants with the following values:

`TOTAL_SUPPLY: u32 = 300`

`SYMBOL: felt252 = 'STRK'`

`MESSAGE: felt252 = 'Cairo rulez'`

- Proceed and create 3 getter functions: `get_supply`, `get_symbol`, and `get_message`. 
- While we have yet to delve into functions, you can do a little bit of research here and implement them. You can do it!

Check that your `.cairo` file compiles and the test passes by executing the command `snforge test basic_types_2`.
