# Cairo Crash Course

## Control Flow - Exercise 1 - if's and only if's
In this control flow exercise you will practice `if` statements in different variants.

### Contract Implementation
Complete the function `practice_if()` in `control_flow_exercise_1.cairo`, which returns a `u32`.

Using the code given, complete the value assignment to `message` variable based on the `always_the_truth` variable:
- If true -> `l33t`
- else -> `not_l33t`

Once completed run the command `snforge test control_flow_1` to check that all tests pass.
