## Getting started

- To run all tests, use the command `snforge test`.
- To run a specific test file, use the command `snforge test test_name_num`.

## Repository structure

- All the exercises are located in `src/exercises/`
  - The exercises are divided into 2 categories which exist in 2 separate folders: `cairo_crash_course` and `cairo_hacking`
  - Each exercise chapter is represented by a folder, such as `src/exercises/cairo_hacking/first_cairo_contract`.
  - Within each chapter folder, there are subfolders for individual exercises, labeled with the exercise number, e.g.: `src/exercises/cairo_hacking/first_cairo_contract/first_cairo_contract_1`.
- Every exercise includes a Cairo module file (e.g.: `src/exercises/cairo_hacking/first_cairo_contract/first_cairo_contract1.cairo`), which imports the test file and all associated code.
- Initially, the test file is commented out. When you begin working on the exercise, remember to **uncomment the code in the `.cairo` files in the exercise folder!**
  Test files are named in the format `test_name_num.cairo`.

## How to run exercise and complete the exercise

1. Uncomment all the code in the `.cairo` files in the exercise folder.
2. Complete all the TODOs in both the code and the test file.
3. To confirm whether your exercise is completed, run `snforge test exercise`.
   - For instance: `snforge test first_cairo_contract_1`.
   - It is also possible to run the test just with the name of the folder, for instance: `snforge test first_cairo_contract_1`.
4. If the test passes, then you have completed the exercise.
