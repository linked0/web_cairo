# Cairo Crash Course

## Control Flow - Exercise 2 - Simple counter
In this exercise we are going to implement a counter using `loop` and `if` statements to get familiar with the functionality of nested conditionals.

### Contract Implementation
Complete the function `conditional_counter()` in `control_flow_exercise_2.cairo`.

Using the `index` variable given and the `loop` skeleton, inside this loop satisfy the following conditions:

1) if index is greater than 20 break the loop.
2) if index is 10, increment the index by 1, then continue to the next iteration.
3) After these 2 conditions, print the index value to the console.
4) After printing the index, increase it's value by 2.
5) Return index.


## Checking the exercise
1. Write in comments what is the expected output which will be printed to the console.
2. Check that the exercises is completed by running the command `snforge test control_flow_2`.
